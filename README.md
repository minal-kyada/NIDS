## Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning Algorithm

➡️ High-level security is crucial for secure communication, and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) complements conventional technologies like firewalls and encryption.

➡️ The proposed IDS model, using algorithms on KDD '99 datasets, aims to detect and prevent various network attacks by classifying traffic as normal or malicious.

➡️ The system identifies four types of attacks and utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a training set for classification.

➡️ IDS is categorized as network-based (monitoring the entire network) or host-based (examining system log files) to identify patterns indicative of malicious activities.
